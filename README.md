## Code and Data

### Keck data
Individual flux and wavelength calibrated spectra are given in tar files, one for each arm (Blue/Red)
of LRIS. The tar files contain spectra as ascii files with format
wavelength (AA), flux (mJy) and error. An additional file provides HJD
for each spectrum.

High state and low state spectra are given in the same format, but without uncertainties.

The difference spectrum between high and low states is provided, as is
a second estimate of the difference spectrum, derived from fitting sinusoids
to lightcurves in narrow wavelength bins (amplSpectrum). The lightcurves themselves
are also provided.

### Palomar data
Flux and wavelength calibrated Palomar spectra are provided in the same format.
